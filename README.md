# Action Cognition and Computation
### Introduction to neuro-based data science

_November 07-11, 2022_

Welcome to the git repository of the Action Cognition and Computation Course

**Objectives:** Introduce fundamental tools for data analysis for different sources of data e.g. behavioral, eye-tracking, EEG data. Main focus will be on data exploration through plotting, hypothesis generation, and hypothesis testing.

**Tools:**  `pandas`, `numpy`, `python-MNE` for analysis. `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for data visualization.

This course is a work in progress. If you find any mistakes or have suggestions, please add them to the issue tracker.

I plan to add video lectures in the notebooks soon, so it's accessible to everyone!





I would like to thank Anne Lang, Franca Boße and Moritz Bammel for helping with the great content and Peter König for his guidance. Finally, I'm grateful for the funding provided by the [Max Planck School of Cognition](https://www.maxplanckschools.de/en/cognition) to complete the project.
