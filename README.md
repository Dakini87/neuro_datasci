# Action Cognition and Computation

_April 05-09, 2021_

Welcome to the git repository of the Action Cognition and Computation Course.

**Objectives:** Introduce fundamental tools for data analysis for different sources of data e.g. behavioral, eye-tracking, EEG data. Main focus will be on data exploration through plotting, hypothesis generation, and hypothesis testing.

**Tools:**  `pandas`, `numpy`, `python-MNE` for analysis. `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for data visualization.

| Day     | Take Away     | Exercises |
| :------------- | :------------- | :----------------|
| Day 1          | Data exploration  | basics of plotting|
| Day 2          | Data wrangling | Behavioral data, Hypothesis testing with ANOVAs |
| Day 3          | Data cleaning | Eye-tracking data, outlier detection|
| Day 4          | Simulating data | EEG data, Fourier transform, |


This course is a work in progress. If you find any mistakes or have suggestions, please add them to the issue tracker.

I plan to add video lectures in the notebooks soon, so it's accessible to everyone!





I would like to thank Anne Lang, Franca Bo√üe and Moritz Bammel for helping with the great content.
